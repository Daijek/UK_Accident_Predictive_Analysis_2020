# Predictive Analysis of Traffic Accidents and Injuries Using Machine Learning on 2020 UK Accident Data
## Overview
<p>
  This project leverages Python and libraries like <b>Pandas</b>, <b>NumPy</b> and <b>Scikit-learn</b> to analyze 2020 UK traffic accident data, identify factors contributing to fatal accidents, and build a machine learning model to predict accident severity.
</p>
<h2>Key Steps</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Data Retrieval:</b> Utilized SQL queries to extract accident data specific to the UK for 2020 from the data.gov.uk website.</li>
  <li><b>Data Cleaning & Analysis:</b> Cleaned and analyzed the dataset using Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify peak accident hours and high-risk days of the week. </li>
  <li><b>Association Rule Mining:</b> Applied the Apriori algorithm to explore the impact of various factors (e.g., weather, road type, time of day) on accident severity. </li>
  <li><b>Clustering Analysis:</b> Used KMeans clustering to perform unsupervised learning, gaining insights into accident patterns in the city of Hull through cluster analysis.</li>
  <li><b>Model Development:</b> Built an ensemble machine learning model by combining Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to accurately predict fatal injury outcomes in road traffic accidents. </li>
  <li><b>Report Creation:</b> Authored a detailed report summarizing the findings from the data analysis and machine learning model development. </li>
</ul>
